                        <p>
                            <strong>Did you know that your unconscious mind is at least ten times the size of your conscious mind?</strong>
                            <br><br>
                            It records and remembers everything you hear, see, say and feel and remembers it permanently. And it never stops working even when you are asleep. We're talking about an awesomely powerful computer, capable of performing a trillion operations a second and constantly processing everything that happens in your body and your environment. And its sole purpose is to keep you safe and happy. 
                            <br><br>
                            That's reassuring, you may well think. But despite its size and power, your unconscious mind is unsophisticated when it comes to exercising judgement. So problems can occur when it does something it believes will keep you safe or happy but in reality has the opposite effect. 
                            <br><br>
                            For example, you might want to lose weight but as a child, your unconscious mind learned to equate eating cake and biscuits with reassurance and comfort, so now whenever you are stressed or worried you reach for the biscuit tin, whether you want to or not. 
                            <br><br>
                            Or, you could be looking to progress at work but whenever you are asked to speak in front of a group of people you panic. Your unconscious (which records everything) remembers a time when you were humiliated when speaking in front of the class at school. So to keep you safe, it induces a fight or flight response with the aim of getting you out of what it perceives to be a dangerous situation. 
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <p>
                            These unconscious responses although well intended produce undesirable results. But the good news is it's relatively easy to re-educate your unconscious mind using hypnotherapy and once the message sinks in your behaviour will change.
                            <br><br>
                            When you consider the power that the unconscious mind has over our behaviour, it's easy to see how the ability to reprogram it with hypnotherapy can improve our lives in so many ways. Whether that is freeing yourself of a serious problem like anxiety or depression, or just improving your golf handicap. 
                            <br><br>

                        <p>In Cognitive Hypnotherapy, there are no 'one size fits all' solutions. Every problem is different and every person is unique. There are a range of different techniques that can be used to unlock a problem, so it's a case of finding out what works for you. These are some of the areas where Cognitive Hypnotherapy is proven to be effective and that I can help you with.</p>

									Many people become used to living with phobias that severely limit their lives. Problems like fear of flying, fear of heights, claustrophobia and even fear of going to the dentist. If you suffer from a phobia, it is usually fairly straightforward to be free of it with Cognitive Hypnotherapy. Phobias are often connected to a past experience that has lodged in the unconscious. Regression techniques can be used to reframe the experience in the mind which then clears the problem.

									Hypnotherapy is often associated with giving up smoking and it is certainly very effective for this but it can work equally well for other common addictions like alcohol, drugs and gambling and more recently online shopping and social media. Very often these problems are connected to an age old experience or association that needs to be addressed. On other occasions, it can be a case of disrupting the repetitive pattern of behaviour and once that is broken the habit falls away. The same applies to behaviours like nail biting, teeth grinding, stammering and OCD.

									This is an area that interests me particularly. Constant anxiety can be debilitating to live with and it's an increasingly common problem in the pressurised, social media dominated world we live in. The good news is that Cognitive Hypnotherapy is very effective at treating it. It is not a magic wand though and if you suffer from anxiety I would normally recommend 4-6 sessions to help you re-educate your unconscious into a new form of behaviour.

									Some people feel that they are 'stuck' and unable to move forward with their lives. Whether this is as a result of low self confidence, low self esteem, depression, or a combination of factors, Cognitive Hypnotherapy can make a difference by helping to identify the root causes and gradually altering the unhelpful thought patterns that have become engrained, enabling you to break out of the spiral of negativity that you are caught in. This is not a quick fix and would normally take 4-6 sessions, occasionally more.

									If you're having trouble sleeping, it's likely to be due to an underlying anxiety of some kind and we can use hypnosis to help identify it and reduce it. If you are having recurring dreams or nightmares, this is usually the unconscious mind's way of trying to tell you something because it continues to process events and problems while you are sleeping. So again, working with your unconscious is the way to resolve the issue.

									Whether you're a professional sports person or just a keen amateur, there are a number of simple ways to help you. These can be positive mental triggers that you can use at certain key moments in a match, techniques that stop you 'getting in your own way' or helpful additions to your routine that boost confidence and eliminate negative thoughts. Once we find what works for you, you'll notice an improvement both in your performance and in your enjoyment of the game. I'm a keen golfer and have used many of these techniques myself to good effect.

									I had a long career in business, eventually selling my company and starting a second career as a Hypnotherapist. I have a good understanding of the kind of issues that you may face in a business environment. Management problems, difficulty managing relationships with partners, colleagues or bosses, stress resulting in reduced performance. Once we have identified the reasons behind the problems and outlined potential solutions, hypnotherapy can be very useful in adjusting your mindset, so that you see problems differently and cope with them more easily.

                            Some people are a little wary of hypnosis because they believe it's something they have never experienced before but in fact we all go into trance states every day. Staring out of the window in a meeting thinking about something completely unrelated, getting lost in a beautiful piece of music, even being so involved in a film on TV that you don't notice what's going on around you. These are everyday trance states and what you experience under hypnosis will feel very similar. 
                            <br><br>
                            In this state, your conscious mind takes a break, so you are not worrying about something you forgot to do at work or thinking about what you are going to have for dinner. When you are this relaxed it's easier to get a message through to your unconscious mind and that is the reason for doing it. You will know exactly what's happening and be perfectly conscious throughout. 
                        </p>

                            After a session you should feel pleasantly relaxed and at one with the world.

                            It's important to point out though, that hypnotherapy is not something that's done to you, it's a collaboration, where we work together and my role is as a kind of guide. In my experience people find the process interesting, enlightening and enjoyable. 
                            <br><br>
                            If you’re wondering whether Cognitive Hypnotherapy could work for you, a good place to start would be with a free 20 minute phone consultation. If you decide to go ahead after this, most of my sessions are now done online, which has the advantage that you can experience the therapy from the comfort of your own home. This became necessary in the pandemic and I have found it is both effective and convenient for people. A session costs &pound;85 and usually last for around an hour but please allow at least an hour and a half.

                        <p>
                            Before becoming a Cognitive Hypnotherapist, I had a career in the Communications business, working in London for twelve years and moving to Glasgow in the 1990's, where I started my own company with two partners, eventually selling it in 2008.
                            <br><br>
                            I have travelled extensively in Africa, the US and Europe and lived in France and Spain, learning to speak both languages fluently. I'm married and have two grown up daughters.
                            <br><br>
                            My training in Cognitive Hypnotherapy was at the Quest Institute in London. This school and its founder Trevor Sylvester are at the cutting edge of Hypnotherapy and I believe have evolved the most effective, dynamic and innovative programme in the country.
                            <br><br>
                            I have a Diploma in Cognitive Hypnotherapy from The Quest institute and I am a member of the National Council for Hypnotherapy and the Complimentary and National Healthcare Council.

                                    "I have suffered for 33 years with sleep deprivation with some nights having absolutely no sleep whatsoever. I was at the end of my tether as I had already sought help before with absolutely no success. It has been a living hell affecting all aspects of my life. Many days were spent in tears with the frustration and desperation of feeling so tired.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Jonathan was highly recommended to me and I admit to feeling both anxious and skeptical. How wrong I was. After only one session I started on my journey to being able to sleep. Within the hour Jonathan had discovered my problem - it was a complete miracle. I couldn't believe it when I woke up the next morning having slept...I was elated. How I wish I had met Jonathan 30 plus years ago -  my life would have been happier and healthier.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Please don't hesitate to seek help from Jonathan as he has a very calming manner, listens without judgement and generally makes you feel you will succeed in overcoming your problem."

His composed demeanour and soothing presence truly empower you to dig deep and talk openly about sensitive personal issues.

                                    All the changes that have come about as a result of working alongside Jonathan are truly sensational. I’ve progressed in several programmatic areas of life in a very short space of time. It’s been utterly astounding how effective his techniques and tapes are when used regularly.

                                    I would highly recommend him to anyone looking to make significant changes in their lives, as his work has lead me to huge positive leaps forward in mine. I am so extremely grateful to have discovered his services."

I immediately felt comfortable and relaxed during our sessions and was pleasantly surprised at how effective it was via Zoom. I continue to listen to the recordings and use Jonathon's suggested techniques to relieve stress and anxiety. Both have been immensely helpful. I have noticed a very positive change in my confidence, self-belief and general happiness since our sessions. It's been a real life-changer and I couldn't recommend him highly enough."

                                    Jonathan immediately put me at ease and his kind manner and thoughtfulness lead me to open up and talk through so many issues with him. I found all of this to be hugely advantageous. This therapy was so much more than just a simple quick Hypnosis but seemed to be a very clever mix of examining my conscious thoughts and then tapping into my unconscious to redirect this. I’m not quite sure how all of this worked, but it did!
                                    I enjoyed the long flight to  and back and even signed us all up to some full on Zip Wire Adventures to test me. I would never have even contemplated this before my visits to Jonathan and the sense of achievement I felt was absolutely fantastic.
                                    I can't thank him enough and would highly recommend this therapy to anyone."

Before I met Jonathan, I suffered from severe night terrors which were having a detrimental impact on my sleeping pattern and causing worry and anxiety in various social situations. Jonathan and I worked as a team to explore the subconscious routes to my problems in a meticulous and empathetic manner. He was very respectful of personal space and together we tackled my problems head on, resulting in me having a far more relaxed state of mind while sleeping. Jonathan has also provided me with various tools and techniques to help address my problems in my own time when required. A thoroughly insightful, enjoyable and effective experience."

I met Jonathan through my job as a taxi driver, after a brief chat he convinced me to give his methods a try and after only a few sessions we began to get to the root of the issue. Jonathan made me feel at ease and therefore I was able to open up. Jonathan's methods have really helped diminish my anxiety beyond my expectations.

                                    The simple, yet highly effective, techniques that Jonathan has suggested have had a positive and potentially transformative impact on my approach to golf. And to life itself."

                                    "I decided to seek Jonathans help for a specific issue that I had. It soon became clear that something lay further behind that and with his help I have obtained a degree of clarity that had previously escaped me. This has led to changes that have been so helpful in my life. A deeper sense of understanding, an ability to handle things differently and a greater degree of patience.

                                    Jonathan seems able to take one to places one did not expect and I am full of admiration for the way in which he has helped me. His focus is amazing and his calm and soothing manner is so reassuring as is his positivity.

                                    I would recommend to anyone who has struggled with elements of their life to undertake sessions with Jonathan. I have gained more from my work with him than I ever did with other methods."

                                    These ‘wobbles’, as I called them, curtailed my life as I was reluctant to leave home before 11am. Jonathan used a number of techniques taking me through the past, the present and into the future. He also gave me several strategies to enforce a more positive mind set, which I use on a daily basis and I am delighted that my ‘wobbles’ have stopped.
                                    The sessions I have had with Jonathan have brought a sense of well-being, inner control and calmness.
                                    I have no hesitation in recommending Jonathan as able to help anyone with issues.

Please don't ask me what he says or does but my consultations with him have had a marked effect. Positivity is the best word to describe my feelings. From my cup being almost always half empty. It is now half to three quarters full or even higher most days.

Jonathan was very understanding and sympathetic and he completely understood what I was describing. I religiously listen to the tapes Jonathan has given me which help to put everything in to perspective. He has taught me to think in a much more positive way and not to always expect the worst.

                                    Jonathan is familiar and friendly. His gentle and easy-going manner allows you to feel comfortable exploring areas of your life that you might not have felt so comfortable exploring on your own.

                                    fetched, I could not have been more wrong. I had been to two therapists prior to meeting
                                    Jonathan both of which i had made little to no progress however, after my first
                                    conversation with Jonathan I almost instantly started to feel a difference and we hadn’t
                                    even started on the hypnotherapy. Just the very manner in which Jonathan conducted our
                                    first session made me view my anxiety in a completely different way so much so that I
                                    went to see him again to also deal with my insomnia.

                                    because of Jonathan’s excellent methods and as a bi-product also solved my fear of flying.
                                    We discovered parts of myself that i did not even know existed and tackled them together,

                                    Jonathan has played a huge role in helping me address issues relating to self confidence
                                    and anxiety. He really helped me to elucidate and articulate the origins of deeply
                                    embedded patterns of thinking. Not only did I learn more about myself, but about how the
                                    unconscious mind controls the majority of our thoughts. Tapping into these repetitive
                                    unconscious thought patterns, with the help of speaking to Jonathan and his voice
                                    recordings, have allowed me to have more control over negative thought patterns as well
                                    as develop an improved self-confidence and boundary setting.

                                    I have been lucky enough to have close friends to confide in. And for this reason, until now
                                    I never felt it necessary to seek professional help. However, Jonathan offered a necessary
                                    objectivity and it was this, coupled with his compassion and empathy that helped me to
                                    really understand myself, my motivations and what was holding me back.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I definitely recommend chatting to Jonathan if you feel that there are certain aspects of
                                    yourself which you wish to improve and to be a better, happier version of yourself!
